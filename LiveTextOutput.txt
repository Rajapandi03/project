“Rich Dad Poor Dad is a starting point for anyone
looking to gain control of their financial furure.”

~ USA TODAY


Why Milestones Are Important

People of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones.
‘We use them to measure time, mark progress,
reflect on the lessons we've learned, and celebrate
accomplishments. They are a way that we integrate past,
present, and future... looking back at where we started,
where we are today... and the promise of all
that the future can hold.

Milestones give meaning to a journey and help us to
not only savor each small step but celebrate the leaps
and bounds that catapult us forward, Whether it’s a
birthday or anniversary, the number of years a business

Milestones give meaning to a journey and help us to
not only savor each small step but celebrate the leaps

and bounds that catapult us forward. Whether it’s a

birthday or anniversary, the number of years a business

has outlasted the competition, the death of an icon, or
an innovation that will chan;

ge our lives, milestones are a
Part of all that we are.

+ and all that we will become.

A quarter cent

fury has passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad
was first publi

shed — 25 years since April 8, 1997 —
any things in our world have changed.
One thing that has not changed is the

pressing need
for and the power of financial ed

lucation.
